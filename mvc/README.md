# Python MVC Study Project

This project is designed to demonstrate and explore the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern in Python. It is intended as a learning resource for those who are new to the MVC structure or want to deepen their understanding of how it can be implemented in Python applications.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of the MVC pattern in Python. The project is structured to separate **data handling (Model)**, **user interface (View)**, and **business logic (Controller)**. The main goal of this separation is to make the codebase modular, maintainable, and scalable.

Key Features:

- Separation of concerns into Model, View, and Controller layers.
- Simple user interaction with data through the command-line interface.
- Easily extendable to handle more complex scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: The core language for the project.
- **SQLite** (optional): A simple database for storing data (can be replaced with any other database).
- **Flask** (optional): For handling web-based views, if you wish to extend the project beyond command-line interaction.

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVC pattern, divided into three main components:

```
├── app/
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   └── user_controller.py  # Contains logic to handle requests and process user data.
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── user.py             # Defines the data structures and interaction with the database.
│   ├── views/
│   │   └── user_view.py        # Handles displaying information to the user.
│   └── main.py                 # Entry point of the application.
├── tests/
│   └── test_user.py            # Unit tests for the application.
├── README.md                   # Project overview and instructions.
└── requirements.txt            # List of dependencies.
```

- **Controllers**: Handle input from the user, process the data (communicating with the Model), and determine what response (or View) to display.
- **Models**: Manage the data. They define the structure of the data, connect to the database (if applicable), and process business rules.
- **Views**: Manage the output. They take the data processed by the Controller and display it to the user in a meaningful way.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. You can install dependencies with `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-mvc-study.git
cd python-mvc-study
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python app/main.py
```

## Usage

Once the project is running, you'll be prompted with a simple command-line interface where you can interact with the application.

For example, in the case of a user management system:

- **Create a user**: Input your details, and the controller will validate and save the data.
- **View a user**: Retrieve and display user data through the view, processed by the controller and fetched from the model.

You can extend the project by adding new models, controllers, and views as necessary. Each new feature should follow the MVC pattern.

### Example

Here is an example interaction:

```
1. Add a new user
2. View user details
3. Exit
```
